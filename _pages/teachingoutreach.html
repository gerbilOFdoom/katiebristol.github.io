    excerpt: "First-generation, low-income, and other disadvantaged students can 
    find university environments to be daunting and full of obstacles that are 
    invisible to those who are more privileged. For this reason, many never attend college; 
    for those that do, [around 80% do not graduate within 6 years](http://pellinstitute.org/indicators/reports_2019.shtml). 
    As a first-generation student myself, I was well aware of this problem and wanted 
    to help mitigate it.

    I spent multiple years working with [Summer Youth Programs](https://www.mtu.edu/syp/) (SYP) at Michigan 
    Technological University (MTU), a pre-college outreach initiative 
    for young people to learn about STEM and gain experience in a relaxed, hands-on way. 
    I worked as a mentor for over 500 diverse students aged 10-17 who attended the 
    Women in Engineering, Engineering Scholars, and Engineering Exploration programs. 
    Topics covered included geology, mineralogy/petrology, geological engineering, 
    natural hazard mitigation, volcanology, and more. End surveys from the most recent 
    year showed that 88% of the students I worked with gained confidence in their 
    ability to be successful in college."
