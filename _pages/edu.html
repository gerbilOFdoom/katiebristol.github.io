    title: "Rock magnetic properties of extraterrestiral mineral assemblages"
    excerpt: "In addition to magnetic processes on Earth, I am interested in constraining the magnetic fields
    of the ancient Solar nebula. To explore this topic, I have worked on several projects related to meteorites
    and their constituents. My main goal is to better understand the minerals in these magnetic assemblages and how they
    carry magnetic records through deep time. I do this primarily through rock magnetic methods such as hysteresis
    and FORC analysis, thermomagnetic characterization, and thermal and alternating field demagnetization experiments."

I wrote my <a href="https://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/etdr/1049/">MS Thesis</a>
on the rock magnetic properties of the Daule L5 ordinary chondrite meteorite.
