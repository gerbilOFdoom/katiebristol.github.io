    title: "Summer Youth Programs"
    excerpt: "I spent multiple years working with Summer Youth Programs (SYP) at Michigan Technological 
    University (MTU), a pre-college outreach initiative for young people to learn about STEM 
    and gain experience in a relaxed, hands-on way. I worked as a mentor for over 500 diverse 
    students aged 10-17 who attended the Women in Engineering, Engineering Scholars, and Engineering 
    Exploration programs. Topics covered included geology, mineralogy/petrology, geological engineering, 
    natural hazard mitigation, volcanology, and more. End surveys from the most recent year showed that 
    88% of the students I worked with gained confidence in their ability to be successful in college."
